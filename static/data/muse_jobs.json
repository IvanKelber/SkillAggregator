The team takes on the unique opportunity of interfacing directly with stakeholders around the company to build full stack applications with an array of technologies. In fact, our team codes with some of the newest and most diverse set of technologies within Airbnb from Node.js for real time chat and notifications, to Ruby on Rails for customer resolutions, to React.js for user tickets, to Elastic Search for full text user searching.</p>\n<p>Our product feedback loop is immediate which means we can rapidly iterate and deploy.\u00a0 If you enjoy building full stack applications from the ground up, leveraging the newest technologies to delight users, and executing like an entrepreneur, then you\u2019ve found the right place.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are examples of work that Software Engineers have done at Airbnb?</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We own the application that hundreds of Customer Experience agents use to triage and solve issues at scale.</li>\n<li>Our payments platform transmits billions of dollars in dozens of different currencies among over 100 countries.

You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices -- and love it as much as we do.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br><em><strong>Soft Skills\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mentoring a team and bringing them up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, but with the breadth of technical experience you\u2019ll bring to the table, you\u2019ll be an invaluable teacher to your less-experienced peers.</li>\n<li>Thinking big and acting fast. You\u2019ll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you\u2019re ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations\u2019 tech strategies.</li>\n<li>Influencing priorities, for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you\u2019re able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary.</li>\n<li>Finesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client\u2019s organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you\u2019ll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br><em>And here\u2019s some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ThoughtWorks.</em></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A real commitment to \u201cchanging the face of IT\u201d -- our way of thinking about diversity and inclusion. Over the past ten years, we\u2019ve implemented a lot of initiatives to make ThoughtWorks a place that reflects the world around us, and to make this a welcoming home to technologists of all stripes. We\u2019re not perfect, but we\u2019re actively working towards true gender balance for our business and our industry, and you\u2019ll see that diversity reflected on our project teams and in offices. \u00a0</li>\n<li>Continuous learning. You\u2019ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.</li>\n<li>No pigeon-holing: at ThoughtWorks, there\u2019s no applying to new roles. With time, you\u2019ll build trust and credibility and move easily into new roles if you\u2019re inclined, like trying out life in a QA or BA\u2019s shoes.</li>\n<li>Miles on miles. As consultants, we travel to the client sites every week. At first, you\u2019ll likely travel domestically, but with time, you\u2019ll find opportunities to travel around the world (and rack up some major points along the way.)</li>\n<li>Support to grow as a technologist outside of your role at ThoughtWorks. This is why ThoughtWorkers have written over 100 books and can be found speaking at (and, ahem, keynoting) tech conferences all over the world. We love to learn and share knowledge, and you\u2019ll find a community of passionate technologists eager to back your endeavors, whatever they may be. You\u2019ll also receive financial support to attend conferences every year.</li>\n<li>An organizational commitment to social responsibility. ThoughtWorkers challenge each other to be just a little more thoughtful about the world around us, and we believe in using our profits for good. All around the world, you\u2019ll find ThoughtWorks supporting great causes and organizations in both official and unofficial capacities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br><em>A few important things to know:</em></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Travel is required. Projects are almost exclusively on customer site, so ThoughtWorkers need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our consultants travel every week and fly home for weekends. We do our best to take people\u2019s personal situations into account, but we know it\u2019s not for everyone.</li>\n<li>Residing near one of our North America offices in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Atlanta or San Francisco is required. If you live elsewhere, we\u2019ll work with you to find a home base for relocation.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>Ref:*CI</span></p>\n\n<div>\n<p><em>It is the policy of ThoughtWorks, Inc. to provide a work environment free of discrimination.

        "contents": "<p><strong>Brief description:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The MuleSoft Cloud Platform team is looking for a talented full stack engineer with a passion for building large-scale applications and killer user interfaces. The ideal candidate must know the difference between building good products and great products. If you know what Node.js, Angular and ReactJS are, and what the motivations for using them would be, you don't want to miss this exciting opportunity to influence every other SaaS company out there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why should you join MuleSoft?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Every major company is adopting more and more cloud services, AND building lots of apps themselves, AND publishing their own APIs. We're talking hundreds to thousands of integration points for a single reasonably-large enterprise to glue together. In fact, increasingly the heart of a company's applications is in the glue itself. And that makes for an exponentially-big problem for enterprises: how do you assemble numerous services into coherent business flows, efficiently and effectively, then operate them for months and years, and keep them up to date as all these APIs evolve? How do you even know all the integration endpoints and flows you have at any given time?</p>\n\n<p>At MuleSoft, we're already solving this for thousands of companies, but now we're taking it to the next level, with CloudHub: a cloud-based environment which pairs with the widely-adopted on-premise Mule 'bus' to be the nexus of an entire enterprise's integrations. In short, CloudHub is where modern enterprises run their integration glue.</p>\n\n<p>And that's why MuleSoft has incredible momentum with some of the biggest companies in the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you come in?</strong></p>\n\n<p>First, MuleSoft is investing heavily in our Anypoint platform. There\u2019s still new product lines to be built completely from scratch; and since we're still a startup, you get to be a big part of a small team with a very broad impact. This is not a place to rest on your laurels: this is a place to make your mark on the world.</p>\n\n<p>Second, you get to work on great technologies: client-side MVC using AngularJS building on RESTful back-end APIs; LESS; grunt; node.js, ReactJS and of course; perhaps you'll bring in some other new technology to the stack.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, and maybe the coolest part: since MuleSoft already has the world's biggest companies on board, everything you do is poised to make a huge impact.</p>\n\n<p>And you? You already know you can create killer UI's based on the work of designers and your own creativity; and it's a given that you're a master of all things HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript. But isn't it time you turned your attention to a really, really big problem?</p>\n\n<p><strong>About You:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Experience building large-scale web apps with a reusable component architecture</li>\n<li>Care deeply about UX, design and simplicity</li>\n<li>Good grasp of HTML5, CSS and LESS/SASS/PostCSS</li>\n<li>Production experience with large Angular, React or other modern UI frameworks</li>\n<li>Experience taming and managing state in complex apps using patterns like Flux/Redux</li>\n<li>Strong JavaScript skills and an understanding of functional programming, closures, ES2015, asynchronous programming and handling large amounts of data client-side</li>\n<li>Experience with warp drive installation and maintenance under zero gravity conditions</li>\n<li>Understanding of, and bias for, testing using tools like Karma, Mocha, Chai and Sinon</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>About Our Benefits:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Competitive salaries + twice yearly market salary revisions</li>\n<li>Pre-IPO Equity</li>\n<li>OSDE 310 health care for you and your family</li>\n<li>\u201cNo policy\u201d vacation policy</li>\n<li>Mac or PC</li>\n<li>Top quality offices with spacious working space</li>\n<li>Fully stocked kitchen, regular catered lunches</li>\n<li>Onsite English lessons. \u00a0Opportunities to travel to our HQ in San Francisco</li>\n<li>Annual, all-company weeklong MeetUp trip for collaboration, learning and inspiration</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>"

They\u2019ve also been writing books, speaking at conferences, and helping push software development forward -- changing companies and even industries along the way.</p>\n\n<p>As consultants, we work on-site with our clients to ensure we\u2019re delivering the best possible solution. Our Lead Dev plays an important role in leading these projects to success.</p>\n\n<p>Curious what makes a developer a Lead around these parts? <em><strong>A lead is</strong></em>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Often the day-to-day primary point of contact with our clients</li>\n<li>Able to strategically lead a project team to successful delivery</li>\n<li>Excited to mentor, influence and lead a team of ThoughtWorkers and clients</li>\n<li>An expert in at least one language or domain, and maybe in 2 or more</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br><em>We believe that to flourish in this role, you're good at:</em></h3>\n\n<p><em><strong>Technical Skills</strong></em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Architecture. You should be comfortable working with your team to craft a design: choosing the appropriate technology and designing a solution that both answers the problem at hand, and stays within constraints.</li>\n<li>Coding. Our Leads never go post-technical. \u00a0We think that it\u2019s important for technical leadership to continue to code. \u00a0Our clients don\u2019t all work in one language or platform, and neither do we. As a lead, we\u2019re looking for a breadth of experience in a lot of languages, and expertise in one or two: Java, javascript, and Ruby are high on our list. (Other notables: Python, Scala, .NET, Clojure.) You should also be up to speed on practices like TDD, continuous integration, pairing, and infrastructure automation.</li>\n<li>Understanding and often playing a major part in the entire cycle of software consulting and delivery, from ideation, to project conception, to UX, to code, to testing, to deployment, and around again. \u00a0</li>\n<li>Agile. We believe strongly in agile delivery practices, having implemented them for ourselves and our clients for a long time now. You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices -- and love it as much as we do.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br><em><strong>Soft Skills\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mentoring a team and bringing them up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, but with the breadth of technical experience you\u2019ll bring to the table, you\u2019ll be an invaluable teacher to your less-experienced peers.</li>\n<li>Thinking big and acting fast. You\u2019ll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you\u2019re ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations\u2019 tech strategies.</li>\n<li>Influencing priorities, for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you\u2019re able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary.</li>\n<li>Finesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client\u2019s organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you\u2019ll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br><em>And here\u2019s some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ThoughtWorks.</em></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A real commitment to \u201cchanging the face of IT\u201d -- our way of thinking about diversity and inclusion. Over the past ten years, we\u2019ve implemented a lot of initiatives to make ThoughtWorks a place that reflects the world around us, and to make this a welcoming home to technologists of all stripes. We\u2019re not perfect, but we\u2019re actively working towards true gender balance for our business and our industry, and you\u2019ll see that diversity reflected on our project teams and in offices. \u00a0</li>\n<li>Continuous learning. You\u2019ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.</li>\n<li>No pigeon-holing: at ThoughtWorks, there\u2019s no applying to new roles. With time, you\u2019ll build trust and credibility and move easily into new roles if you\u2019re inclined, like trying out life in a QA or BA\u2019s shoes.</li>\n<li>Miles on miles. As consultants, we travel to the client sites every week. At first, you\u2019ll likely travel domestically, but with time, you\u2019ll find opportunities to travel around the world (and rack up some major points along the way.)</li>\n<li>Support to grow as a technologist outside of your role at ThoughtWorks. This is why ThoughtWorkers have written over 100 books and can be found speaking at (and, ahem, keynoting) tech conferences all over the world. We love to learn and share knowledge, and you\u2019ll find a community of passionate technologists eager to back your endeavors, whatever they may be. You\u2019ll also receive financial support to attend conferences every year.</li>\n<li>An organizational commitment to social responsibility. ThoughtWorkers challenge each other to be just a little more thoughtful about the world around us, and we believe in using our profits for good. All around the world, you\u2019ll find ThoughtWorks supporting great causes and organizations in both official and unofficial capacities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br><em>A few important things to know:</em></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Travel is required. Projects are almost exclusively on customer site, so ThoughtWorkers need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our consultants travel every week and fly home for weekends. We do our best to take people\u2019s personal situations into account, but we know it\u2019s not for everyone.</li>\n<li>Residing near one of our North America offices in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Atlanta or San Francisco is required. If you live elsewhere, we\u2019ll work with you to find a home base for relocation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>It is the policy of ThoughtWorks, Inc. to provide a work environment free of discrimination. The Company will take affirmative action to ensure applicants and ThoughtWorks employees are treated without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ethnic origin, veteran status, family status, disability, sexual orientation,\u00a0gender expression\u00a0or gender identity.\u00a0 This also includes individuals who are perceived to have any of the aforementioned attributes.\u00a0 ThoughtWorks will adhere to all federal, state, and municipal laws and regulations governing employment.</em></p>"

The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p>We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs.

Our Lead Dev plays an important role in leading these projects to success.</p>\n\n<p>Curious what makes a developer a Lead around these parts? <em><strong>A lead is</strong></em>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Often the day-to-day primary point of contact with our clients</li>\n<li>Able to strategically lead a project team to successful delivery</li>\n<li>Excited to mentor, influence and lead a team of ThoughtWorkers and clients</li>\n<li>An expert in at least one language or domain, and maybe in 2 or more</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br><em>We believe that to flourish in this role, you're good at:</em></h3>\n\n<p><em><strong>Technical Skills</strong></em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Architecture. You should be comfortable working with your team to craft a design: choosing the appropriate technology and designing a solution that both answers the problem at hand, and stays within constraints.</li>\n<li>Coding. Our Leads never go post-technical. \u00a0We think that it\u2019s important for technical leadership to continue to code. \u00a0Our clients don\u2019t all work in one language or platform, and neither do we. As a lead, we\u2019re looking for a breadth of experience in a lot of languages, and expertise in one or two: Java, javascript, and Ruby are high on our list. (Other notables: Python, Scala, .NET, Clojure.) You should also be up to speed on practices like TDD, continuous integration, pairing, and infrastructure automation.</li>\n<li>Understanding and often playing a major part in the entire cycle of software consulting and delivery, from ideation, to project conception, to UX, to code, to testing, to deployment, and around again. \u00a0</li>\n<li>Agile. We believe strongly in agile delivery practices, having implemented them for ourselves and our clients for a long time now. You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices -- and love it as much as we do.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br><em><strong>Soft Skills\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mentoring a team and bringing them up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, but with the breadth of technical experience you\u2019ll bring to the table, you\u2019ll be an invaluable teacher to your less-experienced peers.</li>\n<li>Thinking big and acting fast. You\u2019ll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you\u2019re ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations\u2019 tech strategies.</li>\n<li>Influencing priorities, for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you\u2019re able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary.</li>\n<li>Finesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client\u2019s organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you\u2019ll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br><em>And here\u2019s some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ThoughtWorks.</em></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A real commitment to \u201cchanging the face of IT\u201d -- our way of thinking about diversity and inclusion. Over the past ten years, we\u2019ve implemented a lot of initiatives to make ThoughtWorks a place that reflects the world around us, and to make this a welcoming home to technologists of all stripes. We\u2019re not perfect, but we\u2019re actively working towards true gender balance for our business and our industry, and you\u2019ll see that diversity reflected on our project teams and in offices. \u00a0</li>\n<li>Continuous learning. You\u2019ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.</li>\n<li>No pigeon-holing: at ThoughtWorks, there\u2019s no applying to new roles. With time, you\u2019ll build trust and credibility and move easily into new roles if you\u2019re inclined, like trying out life in a QA or BA\u2019s shoes.</li>\n<li>Miles on miles. As consultants, we travel to the client sites every week. At first, you\u2019ll likely travel domestically, but with time, you\u2019ll find opportunities to travel around the world (and rack up some major points along the way.)</li>\n<li>Support to grow as a technologist outside of your role at ThoughtWorks. This is why ThoughtWorkers have written over 100 books and can be found speaking at (and, ahem, keynoting) tech conferences all over the world. We love to learn and share knowledge, and you\u2019ll find a community of passionate technologists eager to back your endeavors, whatever they may be. You\u2019ll also receive financial support to attend conferences every year.</li>\n<li>An organizational commitment to social responsibility. ThoughtWorkers challenge each other to be just a little more thoughtful about the world around us, and we believe in using our profits for good. All around the world, you\u2019ll find ThoughtWorks supporting great causes and organizations in both official and unofficial capacities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br><em>A few important things to know:</em></h3>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Travel is required. Projects are almost exclusively on customer site, so ThoughtWorkers need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our consultants travel every week and fly home for weekends. We do our best to take people\u2019s personal situations into account, but we know it\u2019s not for everyone.</li>\n<li>Residing near one of our North America offices in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Atlanta or San Francisco is required. If you live elsewhere, we\u2019ll work with you to find a home base for relocation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span>Ref:*CI</span></p>\n\n<div>\n<p><em>It is the policy of ThoughtWorks, Inc. to provide a work environment free of discrimination.

Because these kinds of people are the ones who build something new, something bold the world has never seen before. They are the people you\u2019ll stay thirty minutes after work is done to talk with, just so that you can hear what they think about data. Or journalism. Or the multiverse. Or dogs. We have a team full of those people. Because when you gather a group of diverse, kind, thoughtful people like that -- like ours -- \u00a0work isn\u2019t work.

We never need to check our code coverage to know that it's at 100%: with disciplined TDD, no line of code will be written without a test.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>We are Agile:</strong><span> development methodologies mean different things to different people. For us? We have a story card wall and release a few times a week.

        "contents": "<p>The MuleSoft Cloud Platform team is looking for talented a UI developer with a passion for killer user interfaces. The ideal candidate must know the difference between good UI and great UI. If you know what jQuery, Ext, prototype, Angular and ReactJS are, and what the motivations for using them would be, you don't want to miss this exciting opportunity to influence every other SaaS company out there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why should you join MuleSoft?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Every major company is adopting more and more cloud services, AND building lots of apps themselves, AND publishing their own APIs. We're talking hundreds to thousands of integration points for a single reasonably-large enterprise to glue together. In fact, increasingly the heart of a company's applications is in the glue itself. And that makes for an exponentially-big problem for enterprises: how do you assemble numerous services into coherent business flows, efficiently and effectively, then operate them for months and years, and keep them up to date as all these APIs evolve? How do you even know all the integration endpoints and flows you have at any given time?</p>\n\n<p>At MuleSoft, we're already solving this for thousands of companies, but now we're taking it to the next level, with CloudHub: a cloud-based environment which pairs with the widely-adopted on-premise Mule 'bus' to be the nexus of an entire enterprise's integrations. In short, CloudHub is where modern enterprises run their integration glue. And that's why MuleSoft has incredible momentum with some of the biggest companies in the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you come in?</strong></p>\n\n<p>First, MuleSoft is investing heavily in our Anypoint platform. There\u2019s still new product lines to be built completely from scratch; and since we're still a startup, you get to be a big part of a small team with a very broad impact. This is not a place to rest on your laurels: this is a place to make your mark on the world.</p>\n\n<p>Second, you get to work on great technologies: client-side MVC using AngularJS building on RESTful back-end APIs; LESS; grunt; node.js, ReactJS and of course; perhaps you'll bring in some other new technology to the stack.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, and maybe the coolest part: since MuleSoft already has the world's biggest companies on board, everything you do is poised to make a huge impact.</p>\n\n<p>And you? You already know you can create killer UI's based on the work of designers and your own creativity; and it's a given that you're a master of all things HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript. But isn't it time you turned your attention to a really, really big problem?</p>\n\n<p><strong>About You:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Care deeply about UX, design and simplicity</li>\n<li>Good grasp of HTML5, CSS and LESS/SASS/PostCSS</li>\n<li>Production experience with large Angular, React or other modern UI frameworks</li>\n<li>Experience building large-scale web apps with a reusable component architecture</li>\n<li>Experience taming and managing state in complex apps using patterns like Flux/Redux</li>\n<li>Strong JavaScript skills and an understanding of functional programming, closures, ES2015, asynchronous programming and handling large amounts of data client-side</li>\n<li>Experience with warp drive installation and maintenance under zero gravity conditions</li>\n<li>Understanding of, and bias for, testing using tools like Karma, Mocha, Chai and Sinon</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>About Our Benefits:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Competitive salaries + twice yearly market salary revisions</li>\n<li>Pre-IPO Equity</li>\n<li>OSDE 310 health care for you and your family</li>\n<li>\u201cNo policy\u201d vacation policy</li>\n<li>Mac or PC</li>\n<li>Top quality offices with spacious working space</li>\n<li>Fully stocked kitchen, regular catered lunches</li>\n<li>Onsite English lessons. \u00a0Opportunities to travel to our HQ in San Francisco</li>\n<li>Annual, all-company weeklong MeetUp trip for collaboration, learning and inspiration</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>"

Braintree lets you move money from one place to another safely and securely. It sounds complex (and it is), but we make it so simple, you wouldn't know we were there.</p>\n\n<p><span>At Braintree, opportunities to shine happen daily. We value what makes you different, and encourage you to act on your ideas -- no matter how pie-in-the-sky. You bring skills and a customer-first mentality, and we'll bring the tools and environment you need to do the best work of your life.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span>Check us out - Braintree on\u00a0<a href=\"http://muse.cm/1wWa28H\"><span>The Muse</span></a><span> | </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/braintree\"><span>LinkedIn</span></a><span> |\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Braintree-EI_IE424728.11,20.htm\">Glassdoor</a>\u00a0|\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/braintree/?fref=ts\"><span>Facebook</span></a><span> | </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/braintree\"><span>Twitter</span></a></span></strong></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Engineering Team Culture:</em><br></strong></p>\n\n<p><span>We take a generalist approach to hiring.

We work in an open team room; no cubicles or private offices. Communication is key to our process, and we don't want to hinder it with walls. </span></p>\n\n<p><strong>We test:</strong><span> testing is at the forefront of our development philosophy. We never need to check our code coverage to know that it's at 100%: with disciplined TDD, no line of code will be written without a test. </span></p>\n\n<p><strong>We are Agile:</strong><span> development methodologies mean different things to different people. For us? We have a story card wall and release a few times a week. We keep the team in sync with daily stand-ups and have a retrospective once a month to discuss things that are going well and opportunities for improvements.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Types of projects we work on:</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/products-and-features/marketplace\">Marketplace</a>\u00a0\u2014</span><span>\u00a0split payments, made simple.

We are looking for an instructor with strong JavaScript experience to play a key role on our growing instructional team.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why teach our Web Development Immersive?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you are looking to make a life-changing impact by sharing your love for software development with the next generation of developers, we\u2019d love for you to consider joining our team. We deliver more than just skills training, and are looking for teachers who share our vision for a community of lifelong learners pursuing work that they love. As a full-time teacher for our flagship full-time web development program, you will join us on one of our many campuses to:</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Work closely with one or more co-instructors to guide students through a rigorous, transformational journey towards apprenticeship in software development.</li>\n<li>Become a better teacher, leader, and mentor as you learn from veteran instructors and our world-class instructional coaches.</li>\n<li>Inspire and support students as they identify their passions and drive their own continued learning beyond the curriculum.</li>\n<li>Adapt our global curriculum and use it to guide your teaching, building your own lesson plans as needed and contributing back your lessons learned over time.</li>\n<li>Facilitate a safe, supportive, and energetic community that welcomes the various needs and learning styles of your students.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>\n\n<p>General Assembly is a venture-backed, NYC-based startup focusing on education for individuals and enterprises in the areas of technology, design, and entrepreneurship.

In general, our curriculum is scaffolded to follow the historical evolution of web development. We start by teaching the fundamentals of programming and web design through JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. About 25% of our course (normally unit 2 of 4) focuses on Rails MVC or similar framework, using that context to introduce databases, security, and other foundational knowledge. The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p>We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs. About 20% of overall class time is spent on dedicated project work.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Required Skills and Qualifications</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You are the person that your colleagues naturally gravitate to when they are trying to figure something out.</li>\n<li>You are eager to shape the skills, minds, and careers of the newest generation of web developers.</li>\n<li>You are eager to become a better teacher and learn from your colleagues.</li>\n<li>You have at least 3+ years of experience working on a software development team.</li>\n<li>You have working experience in both front-end and back-end development, and are fluent in</li>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML and CSS</li>\n<li>Full-stack JavaScript (strong JavaScript highly preferred)</li>\n<li>At least one JS MV* framework (Angular, Backbone, or React preferred)</li>\n<li>SQL databases (we generally use PosgreSQL)</li>\n<li>NoSQL (we generally cover MongoDB and Redis)</li>\n<li>At least one additional object-oriented language (Ruby preferred)</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Preferred Qualifications</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You have previous experience teaching web development or other technical skills, through a course, team training, or other delivery method</li>\n</ul>"

About 25% of our course (normally unit 2 of 4) focuses on Rails MVC or similar framework, using that context to introduce databases, security, and other foundational knowledge. The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.</p>\n\n<p>We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs. About 20% of overall class time is spent on dedicated project work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Required Skills and Qualifications</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You are the person that your colleagues naturally gravitate to when they are trying to figure something out.</li>\n<li>You are eager to shape the skills, minds, and careers of the newest generation of web developers.</li>\n<li>You have at least 3+ years of experience working on a software development team.</li>\n<li>You have working experience in both front-end and back-end development, and are fluent in</li>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML and CSS</li>\n<li>Full-stack JavaScript (strong JavaScript highly preferred)</li>\n<li>At least one JS MV* framework (Angular, Backbone, or React preferred)</li>\n<li>SQL databases (we generally use PosgreSQL)</li>\n<li>NoSQL (we generally cover MongoDB and Redis)</li>\n<li>At least one additional object-oriented language (Ruby preferred)</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>General Assembly is a licensed school in the state of New York and all instructors are required to be licensed by the State.

        "contents": "<p>Our developers have been contributing code to major organizations and open source projects for over 25 years now. They\u2019ve also been writing books, speaking at conferences, and helping push software development forward -- changing companies and even industries along the way.</p>\n\n<p>As consultants, we work on-site with our clients to ensure we\u2019re delivering the best possible solution. Our Lead Dev plays an important role in leading these projects to success.</p>\n\n<p>Curious what makes a developer a Lead around these parts? <em><strong>A lead is</strong></em>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Often the day-to-day primary point of contact with our clients</li>\n<li>Able to strategically lead a project team to successful delivery</li>\n<li>Excited to mentor, influence and lead a team of ThoughtWorkers and clients</li>\n<li>An expert in at least one language or domain, and maybe in 2 or more</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br><em>We believe that to flourish in this role, you're good at:</em></h3>\n\n<p><em><strong>Technical Skills</strong></em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Architecture. You should be comfortable working with your team to craft a design: choosing the appropriate technology and designing a solution that both answers the problem at hand, and stays within constraints.</li>\n<li>Coding. Our Leads never go post-technical. \u00a0We think that it\u2019s important for technical leadership to continue to code. \u00a0Our clients don\u2019t all work in one language or platform, and neither do we. As a lead, we\u2019re looking for a breadth of experience in a lot of languages, and expertise in one or two: Java, javascript, and Ruby are high on our list. (Other notables: Python, Scala, .NET, Clojure.) You should also be up to speed on practices like TDD, continuous integration, pairing, and infrastructure automation.</li>\n<li>Understanding and often playing a major part in the entire cycle of software consulting and delivery, from ideation, to project conception, to UX, to code, to testing, to deployment, and around again. \u00a0</li>\n<li>Agile. We believe strongly in agile delivery practices, having implemented them for ourselves and our clients for a long time now. You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices -- and love it as much as we do.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br><em><strong>Soft Skills\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mentoring a team and bringing them up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, but with the breadth of technical experience you\u2019ll bring to the table, you\u2019ll be an invaluable teacher to your less-experienced peers.</li>\n<li>Thinking big and acting fast. You\u2019ll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you\u2019re ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations\u2019 tech strategies.</li>\n<li>Influencing priorities, for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you\u2019re able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary.</li>\n<li>Finesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client\u2019s organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you\u2019ll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br><em>And here\u2019s some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ThoughtWorks.</em></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A real commitment to \u201cchanging the face of IT\u201d -- our way of thinking about diversity and inclusion. Over the past ten years, we\u2019ve implemented a lot of initiatives to make ThoughtWorks a place that reflects the world around us, and to make this a welcoming home to technologists of all stripes. We\u2019re not perfect, but we\u2019re actively working towards true gender balance for our business and our industry, and you\u2019ll see that diversity reflected on our project teams and in our offices. \u00a0</li>\n<li>Continuous learning. You\u2019ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.</li>\n<li>No pigeon-holing: at ThoughtWorks, there\u2019s no applying to new roles. With time, you\u2019ll build trust and credibility and move easily into new roles if you\u2019re inclined, like trying out life in a QA or BA\u2019s shoes.</li>\n<li>Miles on miles. As consultants, we travel to the client sites every week. At first, you\u2019ll likely travel domestically, but with time, you\u2019ll find opportunities to travel around the world (and rack up some major points along the way.)</li>\n<li>Support to grow as a technologist outside of your role at ThoughtWorks. This is why ThoughtWorkers have written over 100 books and can be found speaking at (and, ahem, keynoting) tech conferences all over the world. We love to learn and share knowledge, and you\u2019ll find a community of passionate technologists eager to back your endeavors, whatever they may be. You\u2019ll also receive financial support to attend conferences every year.</li>\n<li>An organizational commitment to social responsibility. ThoughtWorkers challenge each other to be just a little more thoughtful about the world around us, and we believe in using our profits for good. All around the world, you\u2019ll find ThoughtWorks supporting great causes and organizations in both official and unofficial capacities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br><em>A few important things to know:</em></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Travel is required. Projects are almost exclusively on customer site, so ThoughtWorkers need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our consultants travel every week and fly home for weekends. We do our best to take people\u2019s personal situations into account, but we know it\u2019s not for everyone.</li>\n<li>Residing near one of our North America offices in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Atlanta or San Francisco is required. If you live elsewhere, we\u2019ll work with you to find a home base for relocation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span>Ref:*CI</span></p>\n\n<div>\n<p><em>It is the policy of ThoughtWorks, Inc. to provide a work environment free of discrimination.

It handles a broad spectrum of mission-critical data for our customers (think: most of the prescriptions written in the US, global banking traffic, airline reservations, beer distributor networks\u2026), in the cloud and in data centers. It incorporates a variety of technologies and integrates with many more. At its core are comprehensive metadata capabilities, runtime engines, management capabilities, and a lot of rich user experiences and APIs. <br><br><strong>About the Position:</strong><br><br>The Principal Architect - Platform, within the Office of the CTO, plays a central role in driving the central architecture and the architectural direction of this platform across its varied areas. The focus of this role is on the data modeling, the modularization, the APIs, and the runtimes, and with an eye on the present, the future, and the path between. The impact is direct and major, on the trajectory of the company (you are an owner), on our customers, and on the industry as a whole.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Position Deliverables:<br></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Own overall platform architecture, including its direction, its principles, its various levels of abstraction, and its current state. Drive its information hierarchy and structures, domains of responsibility, key technologies.</li>\n<li>Work closely with the team for each area of the platform to create a shared vision for each area's architecture and how the pieces fit together.</li>\n<li>Keep this real, up to date, agile -- the opposite of an ivory tower.</li>\n<li>Iteratively evolve the platform architecture based on discoveries made while \"peeling the onion\", real-world implementation experience, product feedback, roadmap priorities, and other realities.</li>\n<li>Create effective communication vehicles for the platform architecture targeted at a spectrum of audiences and needs, external and internal.</li>\n<li>Architect not only the long-term state but also the path to get there, accounting for near-term product deliverables, technical debt, and the maturity and likely evolution of relevant technologies.</li>\n<li>Lead by example and work closely with engineering on strategic initiatives, designing high quality software, providing detailed feedback in design and code reviews, and bringing the craft of software engineering to bear on everything we do.</li>\n<li>Innovate and lead explorations into new areas and new technologies, within the company but also with other industry leaders.</li>\n<li>Proactively identify architectural weaknesses and recommend appropriate solutions.</li>\n<li>Evaluate new technologies and stay current with a broad range industry trends and developments.</li>\n<li>Hack. Blog and tweet and talk. Often.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>About You:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Deep interest and experience in broad software platforms, including platform information architecture, information flow, the appropriate modularization and loose coupling, flexibility vs specialization and optimization.</li>\n<li>Proven talent for architecting incredibly capable systems that are incredibly simple relative to those capabilities.</li>\n<li>A hands-on, practical approach to software and technology. You code. You deploy. You integrate. You prove by doing.</li>\n<li>Uncanny ability to drive a compelling long-term vision, sketch broad, long-lasting design directions, extract the principles which underpin the architecture, and dive all the way down to very specific implementation details, so you effectively hold the entire platform architecture in your head -- the forest and the trees.</li>\n<li>Matching abilities to capture the architecture in diagrams and documents, communicate it consistently and at the appropriate levels, guard it and evolve it, share it and involve others in advancing it forward.</li>\n<li>Master of architecting systems that can actually be built with finite time and resources, in that developers can run with the architecture, can make it their own, can translate it to the daily decisions that make up software development, and can inform the architecture.</li>\n<li>A great collaborator: someone whom the strong developers, leads, and architects on the teams want to work with, to follow through thick and thin; someone they understand and who understands them; an obvious leader of leaders.</li>\n<li>Exemplary track record of significant, ideally game-changing innovation and creativity.</li>\n<li>A can-do approach backed by accomplishments: they said it couldn\u2019t be done, so I came in and found a smart way and made it happen, and ended up knocking it out of the park.</li>\n<li>Deep, hands-on expertise in cloud architectures (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, distributed systems) and approaches to address their unique management and security considerations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>About Our Benefits:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-IPO equity</li>\n<li>Competitive medical, dental, and vision insurance for you and your family</li>\n<li>401(k) and pre-tax health care, dependent care and commuter benefits (FSA)</li>\n<li>\u201cNo policy\u201d vacation policy</li>\n<li>Commute up the peninsula on the MuleSoft shuttle</li>\n<li>Gym discounts and on-site yoga classes</li>\n<li>Mac or PC</li>\n<li>Fully stocked kitchen, regular catered lunches, weekly happy hours, family nights</li>\n<li>Annual, all-company weeklong MeetUp trip for collaboration, learning and inspiration</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>"

Over the past five years, Wealthfront has rolled out the features and services that now define a new category that we call 'automated investment services.'

We have clients in all 50 states who trust us with $5 billion in assets and growing. With our clients' trust, we believe we can and will change this industry.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We recently launched a new user experience that lays the foundation for a future where Wealthfront is the only financial advisor our clients will ever need. To accomplish this, we redesigned and rebuilt our frontend architecture to deliver a dashboard that provides personalized advice and will ultimately be the center of our clients\u2019 financial lives.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019re looking for engineers who are excited to focus on product engineering across our frontend web server and client-side application and to contribute to other key parts of our infrastructure.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>WHAT YOU\u2019LL WORK ON</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Roswell</strong>: As frontend engineers, we collaborate with a world-class and highly technical design team led by <a href=\"https://blog.wealthfront.com/introducing-kate-aronowitz-vp-design/\">Kate Aronowitz</a>.

We are looking for an instructor with strong JavaScript experience to play a key role on our growing instructional team.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why teach our Web Development Immersive?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you are looking to make a life-changing impact by sharing your love for software development with the next generation of developers, we\u2019d love for you to consider joining our team. We deliver more than just skills training, and are looking for teachers who share our vision for a community of lifelong learners pursuing work that they love. As a full-time teacher for our flagship full-time web development program, you will join us on one of our many campuses to:</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Work closely with one or more co-instructors to guide students through a rigorous, transformational journey towards apprenticeship in software development.</li>\n<li>Become a better teacher, leader, and mentor as you learn from veteran instructors and our world-class instructional coaches.</li>\n<li>Inspire and support students as they identify their passions and drive their own continued learning beyond the curriculum.</li>\n<li>Adapt our global curriculum and use it to guide your teaching, building your own lesson plans as needed and contributing back your lessons learned over time.</li>\n<li>Facilitate a safe, supportive, and energetic community that welcomes the various needs and learning styles of your students.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>\n\n<p>General Assembly is a venture-backed, NYC-based startup focusing on education for individuals and enterprises in the areas of technology, design, and entrepreneurship. We currently have classrooms in 14 cities across 4 continents, with tens of thousands of students coming through our doors.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p>Web Development Immersive is built around the broader history of web development, helping students understand how to be forward-looking web developers with a deep understanding of the underlying, fundamental concepts of programming and the internet.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>What do we teach?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We adapt both our global curriculum and local approach to the technical trends and hiring environment of the times and cities we work in, but today our primary educational approach centers around JavaScript. In general, our curriculum is scaffolded to follow the historical evolution of web development. We start by teaching the fundamentals of programming and web design through JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. About 25% of our course (normally unit 2 of 4) focuses on Rails MVC or similar framework, using that context to introduce databases, security, and other foundational knowledge. The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p>We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs. About 20% of overall class time is spent on dedicated project work.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Required Skills and Qualifications</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You are the person that your colleagues naturally gravitate to when they are trying to figure something out.</li>\n<li>You are eager to shape the skills, minds, and careers of the newest generation of web developers.</li>\n<li>You are eager to become a better teacher and learn from your colleagues.</li>\n<li>You have at least 3+ years of experience working on a software development team.</li>\n<li>You have working experience in both front-end and back-end development, and are fluent in</li>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML and CSS</li>\n<li>Full-stack JavaScript (strong JavaScript highly preferred)</li>\n<li>At least one JS MV* framework (Angular, Backbone, or React preferred)</li>\n<li>SQL databases (we generally use PosgreSQL)</li>\n<li>NoSQL (we generally cover MongoDB and Redis)</li>\n<li>At least one additional object-oriented language (Ruby preferred)</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Preferred Qualifications</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You have previous experience teaching web development or other technical skills, through a course, team training, or other delivery method</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><br><br><br></strong></p>"

We have clients in all 50 states who trust us with $5 billion in assets and growing. With our clients' trust, we believe we can and will change this industry.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We recently launched a new user experience that lays the foundation for a future where Wealthfront is the only financial advisor our clients will ever need.

We are looking for an instructor with strong JavaScript experience to play a key role on our growing instructional team.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Why teach our Web Development Immersive?</strong></p>\n<p>If you are looking to make a life-changing impact by sharing your love for software development with the next generation of developers, we\u2019d love for you to consider joining our team. We deliver more than just skills training, and are looking for teachers who share our vision for a community of lifelong learners pursuing work that they love. As a full-time teacher for our flagship full-time web development program, you will join us on one of our many campuses to:</p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work closely with one or more co-instructors to guide students through a rigorous, transformational journey towards apprenticeship in software development.</li>\n<li>Become a better teacher, leader, and mentor as you learn from veteran instructors and our world-class instructional coaches.</li>\n<li>Inspire and support students as they identify their passions and drive their own continued learning beyond the curriculum.</li>\n<li>Adapt our global curriculum and use it to guide your teaching, building your own lesson plans as needed and contributing back your lessons learned over time.</li>\n<li>Facilitate a safe, supportive, and energetic community that welcomes the various needs and learning styles of your students.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>\n<p>General Assembly is a venture-backed, NYC-based startup focusing on education for individuals and enterprises in the areas of technology, design, and entrepreneurship. We currently have classrooms in 14 cities across 4 continents, with tens of thousands of students coming through our doors.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p>Web Development Immersive is built around the broader history of web development, helping students understand how to be forward-looking web developers with a deep understanding of the underlying, fundamental concepts of programming and the internet.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>What do we teach?</strong></p>\n<p>We adapt both our global curriculum and local approach to the technical trends and hiring environment of the times and cities we work in, but today our primary educational approach centers around JavaScript. In general, our curriculum is scaffolded to follow the historical evolution of web development. We start by teaching the fundamentals of programming and web design through JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. About 25% of our course (normally unit 2 of 4) focuses on Rails MVC or similar framework, using that context to introduce databases, security, and other foundational knowledge. The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p>We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs. About 20% of overall class time is spent on dedicated project work.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Required Skills and Qualifications</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are the person that your colleagues naturally gravitate to when they are trying to figure something out.</li>\n<li>You are eager to shape the skills, minds, and careers of the newest generation of web developers.</li>\n<li>You are eager to become a better teacher and learn from your colleagues.</li>\n<li>You have at least 3+ years of experience working on a software development team.</li>\n<li>You have working experience in both front-end and back-end development, and are fluent in</li>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML and CSS</li>\n<li>Full-stack JavaScript (strong JavaScript highly preferred)</li>\n<li>At least one JS MV* framework (Angular, Backbone, or React preferred)</li>\n<li>SQL databases (we generally use PosgreSQL)</li>\n<li>NoSQL (we generally cover MongoDB and Redis)</li>\n<li>At least one additional object-oriented language (Ruby preferred)</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Preferred Qualifications</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have previous experience teaching web development or other technical skills, through a course, team training, or other delivery method</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br><br><br></strong></p>\n</section>"

        "contents": "<h2>About Intercom</h2>\n\n<div>The way businesses talk to people online today is broken. Intercom is fixing it.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div><a href=\"http://www.intercom.com/\">Intercom</a>\u00a0is the first to bring sales, marketing &amp; customer service products to one messaging platform, helping businesses avoid the stiff, spammy status quo and have real conversations with the people that matter. Designed to feel like the messaging apps you use every day, Intercom is the only business messenger to let you talk to consumers just about anywhere: inside your app, on your website, across social media and via email.</div>\n\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n\n<div>Intercom invented in-app messaging in 2011, and today more than 13,000 businesses use Intercom to reach a billion people around the world. Intercom has 300 employees split between its San Francisco headquarters and its Dublin R&amp;D office, and has raised $116M in venture funding.</div>\n\n<h2>What's the opportunity?</h2>\n\n<p>Intercom is growing fast. We\u2019ve created an environment where product teams, with big ambitions, can ship high quality product to our customers every week. Across a team of more than 60 engineers, we ship changes to production around 100 times each weekday. Our mission is to make web and mobile business personal. Come help us build a world changing product, a long lasting company and the most effective R&amp;D team possible.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019re particularly focused on building an organisation where people thrive, grow in their careers, and enjoy having high impact through their work. We\u2019re looking for experienced engineering managers to help us grow our capabilities and capacity.</p>\n\n<p>The Intercom platform comprises of several different and connected products. Each product is designed and developed \u2014 through invention and iteration \u2014 by a single team. As an engineering manager you\u2019ll partner with a product manager to define a product vision, strategy and roadmap.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll be expected to own your space: work with all disciplines on your team to build, launch and iterate. Talk directly with your customers, take part in usability studies, work with data analysts and researchers to ask the right questions and make good use of the answers.</p>\n\n<p>This is an incredibly rare opportunity to join a company that\u2019s still small but on its way to something much bigger, with a meaningful transformative mission. You\u2019ll work directly with a product, design, and engineering team who\u2019ve worked in places such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple and Zendesk. And best of all, be early enough to hold a leadership position where you have a high impact role in our success over the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>This role is based in our city centre office on St. Stephen\u2019s Green, in Dublin, Ireland. Our entire R&amp;D team is based here. You'll report directly to one of our directors of engineering.</p>\n\n<h2>What will I be doing?</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Collaboratively set a <a href=\"https://blog.intercom.io/666-product-roadmap/\">product and technical direction</a> with your team.</li>\n<li>Support an ambitious group of engineers in their career goals. Work with our people ops team to maintain our high performance and high morale.</li>\n<li>Be actively involved in hiring and growing our engineering team.</li>\n<li>Care about agility as much you care for scalability and availability. Continuous deployment keeps us focused on incremental releases. Even our biggest technical achievements roll out piece by piece, feature flagged out of sight. Projects are kept short and tightly scoped. Teams <a href=\"http://blog.intercom.io/shipping-is-your-companys-heartbeat/\">build a weekly cadence</a> of releases.</li>\n<li>Drive, create and improve operational excellence, quality, security and privacy initiatives within your team and the entire engineering organization.</li>\n<li>Help us evolve our culture.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What skills do I need?</h2>\n\n<p>Management experience is a requirement. New managers are grown through our engineering team, so external hires must have hands-on experience\u00a0of people management.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to take your career in a management direction but haven\u2019t had the opportunity yet, we\u2019d strongly encourage you to <a href=\"https://boards.greenhouse.io/intercom/jobs/130956\">apply for our product engineering role</a>. Career progression is important to us and if management is the path you\u2019d like to take we can help you get there.</p>\n\n<p>You also need to have deep knowledge of a high-level programming language (for example, Ruby, Python, Perl etc.) but it doesn\u2019t need to be a language that we use here! Great people are effective and learn what we use quickly (or introduce us to better ways of working).\u00a0Our ideal is for every team to be comfortable working across the full stack, delivering new features and capabilities from start to finish.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The core Intercom product is a Ruby on Rails application with an Ember.js frontend. We use MySQL and MongoDB for most of our storage, though we\u2019re starting to migrate to other services like Amazon\u2019s DynamoDB.</li>\n<li>We\u2019re actively moving to a service-oriented architecture, with new components built using the most appropriate technology. So far that\u2019s largely been in Java on Dropwizard, and recently using Go.</li>\n<li>Our iOS application and SDK are developed in Objective-C, while our Android application and SDK are Java. The web integration our customers use is built on React. We have API and integration clients for Ruby, Java and PHP with Go and Node.js coming soon (Python and Perl are community supported at the moment).</li>\n<li>Our infrastructure runs entirely within Amazon Web Services and we make use of many of their services (DynamoDB, SQS, etc.) We like to buy the best tools and services where available but will build our own when we need to -- we use an in-house continuous deployment service and built our own lightweight <a href=\"http://blog.intercom.io/how-we-build-software/\">project management tooling</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You will need to be hands-on technically, comfortable reviewing and writing code. We don\u2019t need you to be the strongest or most productive engineer on the team but your on-boarding will involve at least a month working as an engineer on one of our products. We believe this is the best way to get context and build trust before directly managing.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Benefits</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We are a <a href=\"https://blog.intercom.io/a-year-of-working-at-intercom/\">well treated bunch</a>, with awesome benefits! If there\u2019s something important to you that\u2019s not on this list, talk to us! :)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Competitive salary and meaningful equity in a fast-growing start-up</li>\n<li>We serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday! There are also snacks and drinks on tap to keep you topped up</li>\n<li>Regular compensation reviews - we reward great work!</li>\n<li>Peace of mind with life assurance, as well as comprehensive health and dental insurance for you and your dependents</li>\n<li>Open vacation policy and flexible holidays so you can take time off when you need to</li>\n<li>Paid parental leave to let you spend valuable time with your loved ones</li>\n<li>Commuting is a breeze with our generous public transport allowance</li>\n<li>Keep active with our roaming FlyeFit gyms in Dublin membership!</li>\n<li>If you\u2019re cycling, we\u2019ve got you covered on the Cycle-to-Work Scheme. With secure bike storage too!</li>\n<li>MacBooks are our standard, but we\u2019re happy to get you whatever equipment helps you get your job done</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>"

About 25% of our course (normally unit 2 of 4) focuses on Rails MVC or similar framework, using that context to introduce databases, security, and other foundational knowledge. The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p>We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs.

You should be comfortable working with your team to craft a design: choosing the appropriate technology and designing a solution that both answers the problem at hand, and stays within constraints.</li>\n<li>Coding. Our Leads never go post-technical. \u00a0We think that it\u2019s important for technical leadership to continue to code. \u00a0Our clients don\u2019t all work in one language or platform, and neither do we. As a lead, we\u2019re looking for a breadth of experience in a lot of languages, and expertise in one or two: Java, javascript, and Ruby are high on our list. (Other notables: Python, Scala, .NET, Clojure.) You should also be up to speed on practices like TDD, continuous integration, pairing, and infrastructure automation.</li>\n<li>Understanding and often playing a major part in the entire cycle of software consulting and delivery, from ideation, to project conception, to UX, to code, to testing, to deployment, and around again. \u00a0</li>\n<li>Agile. We believe strongly in agile delivery practices, having implemented them for ourselves and our clients for a long time now. You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices -- and love it as much as we do.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br><em><strong>Soft Skills\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mentoring a team and bringing them up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, but with the breadth of technical experience you\u2019ll bring to the table, you\u2019ll be an invaluable teacher to your less-experienced peers.</li>\n<li>Thinking big and acting fast. You\u2019ll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you\u2019re ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations\u2019 tech strategies.</li>\n<li>Influencing priorities, for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you\u2019re able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary.</li>\n<li>Finesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client\u2019s organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you\u2019ll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br><em>And here\u2019s some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ThoughtWorks.</em></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A real commitment to \u201cchanging the face of IT\u201d -- our way of thinking about diversity and inclusion. Over the past ten years, we\u2019ve implemented a lot of initiatives to make ThoughtWorks a place that reflects the world around us, and to make this a welcoming home to technologists of all stripes. We\u2019re not perfect, but we\u2019re actively working towards true gender balance for our business and our industry, and you\u2019ll see that diversity reflected on our project teams and in offices. \u00a0</li>\n<li>Continuous learning. You\u2019ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.</li>\n<li>No pigeon-holing: at ThoughtWorks, there\u2019s no applying to new roles. With time, you\u2019ll build trust and credibility and move easily into new roles if you\u2019re inclined, like trying out life in a QA or BA\u2019s shoes.</li>\n<li>Miles on miles. As consultants, we travel to the client sites every week. At first, you\u2019ll likely travel domestically, but with time, you\u2019ll find opportunities to travel around the world (and rack up some major points along the way.)</li>\n<li>Support to grow as a technologist outside of your role at ThoughtWorks. This is why ThoughtWorkers have written over 100 books and can be found speaking at (and, ahem, keynoting) tech conferences all over the world. We love to learn and share knowledge, and you\u2019ll find a community of passionate technologists eager to back your endeavors, whatever they may be. You\u2019ll also receive financial support to attend conferences every year.</li>\n<li>An organizational commitment to social responsibility. ThoughtWorkers challenge each other to be just a little more thoughtful about the world around us, and we believe in using our profits for good. All around the world, you\u2019ll find ThoughtWorks supporting great causes and organizations in both official and unofficial capacities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br><em>A few important things to know:</em></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Travel is required. Projects are almost exclusively on customer site, so ThoughtWorkers need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our consultants travel every week and fly home for weekends. We do our best to take people\u2019s personal situations into account, but we know it\u2019s not for everyone.</li>\n<li>Residing near one of our North America offices in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Atlanta or San Francisco is required. If you live elsewhere, we\u2019ll work with you to find a home base for relocation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span>Ref:*CI</span></p>\n\n<div>\n<p><em>It is the policy of ThoughtWorks, Inc. to provide a work environment free of discrimination.

In general, our curriculum is scaffolded to follow the historical evolution of web development. We start by teaching the fundamentals of programming and web design through JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. About 25% of our course (normally unit 2 of 4) focuses on Rails MVC or similar framework, using that context to introduce databases, security, and other foundational knowledge. The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p>We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs.

With Magoosh, they don\u2019t have to. Our mission is simple: create products that give students <em>everywhere</em> access to enjoyable, affordable, and quality test prep. We help millions study at their own pace, on their own time regardless of location, social status, or background. Our team is driven to create the best content and study tools because we\u2019re out to change the test prep experience for all.</p>\n\n<p>Magoosh started in 2009 with four co-founders and a few computers. Today, we\u2019re a growing team of 22 in-office employees, with products that are used all over the world in more than 180 countries. Millions have studied with us, downloaded our apps, and watched our videos. And every day, we work with thousands of students to help them get the scores they need to get into the schools they want.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a friendly, passionate, lifelong learner who\u2019s looking to make a real difference in students\u2019 lives, we want you to help us change the test prep world.</p>\n\n<p>Check out our values <a href=\"http://magoosh.com/blog/magoosh-core-values/\">here</a>!</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Job</strong></p>\n\n<p>We\u2019re looking for a Software Engineer. You\u2019ll help us improve our products, shape engineering process, and grow our small but impactful engineering team. We\u2019re a 25+ person company with 3 engineers, so you\u2019ll have a lot of autonomy and responsibility. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve accomplished a lot with a little: we have over 2 million students using our free products, hundreds of thousands who have paid, and revenue well into the millions. Rather than pursuing hyper growth at all costs, we\u2019ve built a profitable and growing company where we truly care about our employees and our students. We\u2019ve turned test prep from a necessary evil into an <a href=\"http://gre.magoosh.com/testimonials/2426\">enjoyable experience</a> at an <a href=\"http://gre.magoosh.com/testimonials/2882\">affordable price</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About Engineering at Magoosh</strong></p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll work on all parts of our stack. So far we use Rails (the core of our application); PhoneGap + AngularJS (for some mobile apps); and ReactNative (for newer mobile apps). We\u2019re hosted on AWS, and you\u2019ll do a little bit of dev ops to make sure things keep running smoothly. We love previous experience with any of these, though we care more about the quality of your engineering than the languages you know.</p>\n\n<p>We build and ship new features quickly and deploy multiple times a day, but don't have many tests (maybe we should add more?).\u00a0We work together to prioritize which bugs and features to work on, but don't try to build or fix everything, focusing on the most important problems. We work closely with non-engineers on the product team and other Magooshers, but we don't receive product requirements documents or create high-fidelity mockups. We all work together to iterate on product designs, as we don't have any dedicated designers. We\u2019re generally in the office from 9-10am to 6-7pm or so and sometimes work from home on evenings and weekends, if inspired or there\u2019s a need.</p>\n\n<p>This position is based in the Magoosh office in Berkeley, CA. You must be authorized to work in the US.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In this position, you will\u2026</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Collaborate on architectural and product decisions</li>\n<li>Plan, scope, design, implement, and monitor features</li>\n<li>Write code often and wherever needed (new features, bug fixes, infrastructure, internal tools etc.)</li>\n<li>Mentor and provide feedback to the engineering team</li>\n<li>Help with hiring for new software engineers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>You have many of the following\u2026</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>5+ years of software engineering experience, although we care more about the quality than quantity of experience</li>\n<li>Built web/mobile applications from scratch</li>\n<li>Released features that have impacted tens of thousands of users</li>\n<li>Mentored or managed one or more software engineers</li>\n<li>Conducted technical interviews for and/or recruited other software engineers</li>\n<li>Experience with front-end and back-end</li>\n<li>A passion for making a difference and leveling the education playing field</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Note: Please feel comfortable applying, even if you don\u2019t meet all the requirements for the position.</em><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>To learn more about our hiring process, check out <a href=\"https://magoosh.com/blog/magoosh-hiring-process/\">our blog post</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

We are flexible on the way you work, and receptive to improving standards / processes.</li>\n<li>Work with the customer, with scope to be involved in user testing, become familiar with our users and artists and use this knowledge to build better products.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What you\u2019ll bring to the Bubble:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Strong architectural pattern knowledge and problem solving.</li>\n<li>A pragmatic grasp of the benefits of agile and lean.</li>\n<li>Solid experience designing and building web applications.</li>\n<li>The ability to write tested, comprehensible, scalable code.</li>\n<li>Advanced experience with TDD.</li>\n<li>Insights into the challenges facing a high-traffic site (ideally A/B testing experience).</li>\n<li>Proven experience building technical foundations of a new project / product.</li>\n<li>Experience delivering multiple end-to-end technical projects.</li>\n<li>A proactive attitude, and the ability to recognise opportunities.</li>\n<li>Ability to communicate complex technical decision making with stakeholders.</li>\n<li>Experience in leading and mentoring junior engineers will get you bonus points too.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Life Inside the Bubble</strong></p>\n\n<p>It all starts with our people and that\u2019s why we have perks that will make you fall in love with us even more, like free breakfast and lunch, daily meditation sessions and a generous personal learning budget to keep you up to date with the latest tech trends!

About 25% of our course (normally unit 2 of 4) focuses on Rails MVC or similar framework, using that context to introduce databases, security, and other foundational knowledge. The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.</p>\n\n<p>We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs.
